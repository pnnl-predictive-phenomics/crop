So if there is only a single limiting nutrient, e.g. $v_{A}\\leq 10$, then we represent FBA with no other upper bounds. Moreover, $v_{A}$ does not need an explicit lower bound of zero, because it will never be negative. As with the inner problem above, we also remove the ATP maintenance requirement.

    "## Resolving incorrect predictions by suppressing growth \n",
    "In this section, we mathematically deal with conditions where growth is predicted, but no growth is experimentally observed. The goal here is to identify model changes that suppress *in silico* growth in a given condition. Importantly, these model changes should not have the side-effect of suppressing growth in other conditions where growth is experimentally observed, such as the condition of wild-type in minimal medium.\n",
    "There are several model changes that can suppress growth. These are basically the reverse of those that restore growth. If the knocked-out gene encodes an isozyme, then removing its isozyme, or requiring both gene products as subunits of an enzyme complex, will lead to reaction removal. Reaction removal can suppress growth if the reaction is essential. Another model change that can suppress growth is to add metabolites to the biomass composition, since this increases the requirements for growth. These two model changes can also be implemented together. However, if neither of these model changes are appropriate, we can suppress growth by removing reactions from the model. To identify the reactions to remove from the model to suppress growth, we implemented an optimization. \n",
    "To illustrate the principles involved in the optimization, we first provide a generic optimization-based solution strategy. We then compare the generic strategy to the optimizations of GrowMatch [[6]](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000308) and Model SEED [[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19555510),[8](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v28/n9/full/nbt.1672.html)]. GrowMatch, Model SEED, and CROP all solve this problem using a large mixed integer linear program (MILP). \n",
    "All of these MILPs involve the dual linear program to FBA because  the dual characterized by the constraint that growth is not feasible. If these programs tried instead to simply set the FBA growth flux to zero, these programs would only represent that no-growth was feasible; they would not represent that growth is infeasible.\n",

    "This strategy independently examines each condition where growth is predicted, but no growth is experimentally observed. For each such condition, a bi-level MILP is created. The purpose of this MILP is to find the optimal set of reactions to remove such that *in silico* growth becomes infeasible in this condition, but remains feasible for a set of control conditions, such as wild-type in minimal medium.\n",

    "The outer minimization problem represents the modeler's optimization to find the optimal set of reactions to remove such that *in silico* growth, represented by $v_{D}$, falls below `minimal_growth`. The constraint $v_{D}\\leq$ `minimal_growth` implies that when there are no solutions that reduce growth to `minimal_growth`, the MILP will not report on solutions that partially reduce growth. However, such solutions may be helpful in cases where no complete solutions can be identified. \n",
    "The inner maximization problem of the program represents FBA, although without the requirement for ATP. We removed this requirement, because it may not be satisfied in the no-growth condition.\n",
    "The Program is a bi-level MILP. To transform it into a single-level MILP, the inner maximization problem must be transformed into a set of constraints. This has been done using an ingenious technique proposed by Maranas’ lab [[10]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12673766) based on the strong duality theorem of linear programming. In this technique, the inner problem is transformed into a set of constraints by including the constraints of the inner problem’s dual, and then constraining the objectives of the inner problem and the inner problem’s dual to be equal.\n",
    "Before illustrating the primal and dual formulations when $z$ is included, we first show this without $z$ for simplicity. Without $z$, the primal is FBA. To represent FBA in a way that will simplify the derivation of its dual, we represent FBA without unnecessary bounds. So if there is only a single limiting nutrient, e.g. $v_{A}\\leq 10$, then we represent FBA with no other upper bounds. Moreover, $v_{A}$ does not need an explicit lower bound of zero, because it will never be negative. As with the inner problem above, we also remove the ATP maintenance requirement. Then, the form of the primal LP is:\n",

    "### Resolving the nonlinearity in the general solution strategy ###\n",
    "Maranas’s lab has previously shown that they can resolve the nonlinearity in program $(15)$ when $z$ is included as a decision variable [[10]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12673766). However, the solution is highly non-trivial, and we are not aware of any publication that derives it. We infer that they resolved this nonlinearity by exploiting the fact that $U_iz_ir_i=0$ for all reactions $i$ except $i=glucose$. $U_iz_ir_i=0$ for all these reactions because $U_iz_ir_i=0$ when $z_i=0$ and when $z_i=1$. If $z_i=0$, then $U_iz_ir_i=0$ trivially. If $z_i=1$ in the above problem, then the upper bound constraints on $v_i$ will not be tight, since $U_i$ is sufficiently large by design. Constraints that are not tight have dual variables of zero, so if $z_i=1$, then $r_i=0$, implying that $U_iz_ir_i=0$. The reaction $i=glucose$ is slightly different. This reaction is required, so we know it will be included in the model. Thus, we know that $z_{glucose}=1$, so $z_{glucose}$ no longer becomes a decision variable. Furthermore, because glucose is the limiting nutrient, we know that $v_{glucose}=U_{glucose}=10$, so its upper bound $U_{glucose}=10$ is tight. Tightness of this upper bound implies that $r_{glucose}\\geq 0$. \n",

Thus, to mathematically express the experimental observation of no-growth (or of growth below a threshold), we need the dual. However, it also follows that once we have the dual, we no longer need FBA. In fact, incorporating both FBA and its dual only provides value if we want to model an intermediate level of growth. This observation appears to have been overlooked. However, only using the dual substantially reduces the MILP’s size.\n",
